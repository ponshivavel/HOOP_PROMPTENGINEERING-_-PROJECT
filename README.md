Built HOOP (Hypothesize–Observe–Optimize–Polish) framework to clean and structure messy meeting notes using AI, demonstrating iterative prompt engineering skills.

# HOOP: Prompt Engineering Project

## Overview
HOOP (Hypothesize → Observe → Optimize → Polish) is a mini prompt engineering project that demonstrates how AI can improve messy real-world text, such as **meeting notes, emails, or to-do lists**, into structured, professional outputs using free Hugging Face models.

---

## Features
- Iterative AI text improvement using the **HOOP framework**:
  1. **Hypothesize** – Test initial AI prompt.
  2. **Observe** – Analyze AI output for clarity and structure.
  3. **Optimize** – Refine the prompt to fix missing information.
  4. **Polish** – Final clean, professional, and visually appealing output.
- Works with **messy inputs**: meeting notes, emails, tasks.
- Uses **free models from Hugging Face** (Flan-T5-small).
- Perfect for **resume or LinkedIn portfolio**.
